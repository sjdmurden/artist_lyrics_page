A webpage showing the song lyrics of an artist. 
Their lyrics aren't on any major song lyric website like Musixmatch or Genius so I decided to make one myself. This site uses responsive web design ensuring it renders well on both both mobile and desktop screen sizes and was built originally for my own personal use.
