        <p>[Verse 1]<br>
        I need to feel complete<br>
        The sight of you makes me want to up and flee<br>
        My eyes they look at you<br>
        I hope that you can feel what I feel too<br>
        But when I brush your breast <br>
        The pain went through me, and I do not jest<br>
        I need you forever and more<br>
        I know I can't have you so I need you more<br></p>

        <p>[Chorus]<br>
        (Back off!) You know you got me looking<br>
        'Cause it's all about tonight<br>
        (Back off!) If the sun still shines it'll be alright<br>
        (Back off!) You know you got me looking<br>
        'Cause it's all about tonight<br>
        (Back off!) If the sun still shines it'll be alright,<br>
        Be alright in the end<br>
        Touch of death!<br></p>

        <p>[Verse 2]<br>
        I need to be discreet<br>
        Taking off your dress, let's look and see<br>
        I look you between the eyes<br>
        Thought that I was going to fucking die<br>
        I asked you, the priest to pray<br>
        And hope we could make it some other day<br>
        I need you forever and more<br>
        I know I can't have you so I need you more<br></p>

        <p>[Chorus]<br>
        (Back off!) You know you got me looking<br>
        'Cause it's all about tonight<br>
        (Back off!) If the sun still shines it'll be alright<br>
        (Back off!) You know you got me looking<br>
        'Cause it's all about tonight<br>
        (Back off!) If the sun still shines it'll be alright,<br>
        Be alright in the end<br>
        Touch of death!<br></p>

        <p>[Guitar Solo]</p>

        <p>[Chorus]<br>
        (Back off!) You know you got me looking<br>
        'Cause it's all about tonight<br>
        (Back off!) If the sun still shines it'll be alright<br>
        (Back off!) You know you got me looking<br>
        'Cause it's all about tonight<br>
        (Back off!) If the sun still shines it'll be alright,<br>
        Be alright in the end<br>
        Touch of death!<br>
        Touch of death!<br>
        Touch of death!<br></p>
